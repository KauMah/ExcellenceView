Overall, we found this experience much more challenging than we had originally expected.
We originally thought it would not be very difficult to simply implement the views we were provided
in our controller however we did run into some problems.

Primarily,  we found that we did not do a great job factoring things out into perfect MVC format.
 Many methods on our model should have been implemented on the controller and it was difficult
 refactoring so that all the methods were in the proper class.  This is the first thing we did
 before even beginning to implement the provided views because we thought in order to implement
 another view it would be easiest if all of our classes were using good MVC practice.  The views
 given to us were very similar to our own however we did learn from their interactive view how we
 couldâ€™ve better implemented the logic for editing keyframes by separating the cases into color,
 height, position, and width.

Our experience with our providers was very positive.  They provided us with the code
on time and responded to the few questions we had in a timely manner.  For the most part their
code was robust, flexible, and easy to understand.
